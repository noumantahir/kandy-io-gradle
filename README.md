# kandy-io-gradle

Purpose of this project will be to develop an easily integratable library for Android. Although there is already a Kandy SDK for android but the purpose of this version will be to make the integration process seamless using Gradle Build system.

Once its done, I ll either try for writing a tutorial either using Android Things OS for Raspberry Pi 3, that ll be integration with HomeBot (another of my project on Collaborizm), or atleast a tutorial and sample app using simple Android OS for phones
